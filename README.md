# EtherIdentity: Decentralized AI-Enhanced KYC Verification System

## Overview
EtherIdentity is a decentralized KYC (Know Your Customer) verification platform that enables users to prove their identity securely on the blockchain. The system utilizes artificial intelligence for document and biometric verification, stores user data encrypted on their local device, and only uploads a cryptographic hash of the verified data to the blockchain via an NFT.

EtherIdentity's innovative architecture ensures full user privacy while allowing regulated institutions (e.g., exchanges) to perform identity verification without ever accessing personal data.

---

## Objectives
- Provide a decentralized and privacy-preserving KYC system
- Empower users with full control over their identity data
- Enable seamless compliance for institutions without compromising user privacy
- Leverage artificial intelligence for reliable identity verification
- Ensure legal accessibility in extreme cases via court orders

## How It Works

### 1. ID Creation Process
Users start the process within the EtherIdentity mobile app:
- Generate a **private key** locally (similar to MetaMask wallet structure)
- Fill out identity form: full name, ID number, address, phone, email, etc.
- Upload the following:
  - Front and back of the identity document
  - A selfie with the ID
  - Liveness verification (simulated or live via camera)

### 2. AI-Based Verification
- Data is analyzed by AI models to verify document authenticity, face match, and liveness.
- If verification score is above a threshold (e.g., 90%), the process proceeds.

### 3. Data Packaging and Encryption
- The verified data is converted into a structured **JSON file**.
- A **SHA-256 hash** of the canonicalized JSON is created (`jsonHash`).
- A **KYC Hash** (`kycHash`) is generated by hashing (`jsonHash + privateKey`).
- The JSON file is encrypted using the user's private key with AES (CBC, PKCS7).
- The encrypted file is stored locally on the device.

### 4. NFT Minting
- The `kycHash` and the user's `privateKey` are sent to the EtherIdentity server.
- The server checks the validity and mints an NFT on-chain with metadata containing:
  - `kycHash`
  - Verification score (e.g., 94%)
  - Timestamp of verification

### 5. Identity Recovery & Import
- When reinstalling the app or switching devices, the user can re-import their ID by uploading:
  - The encrypted JSON file
  - Their private key
- The app decrypts the JSON and recalculates `kycHash`
- The result is validated against the on-chain NFT and the EtherIdentity server

## Security Architecture

### Local Data Ownership
- The encrypted data file ("vault") is never uploaded anywhere
- Only the user possesses the key ("key") to unlock it
- The system follows the **Key + Vault** model

### Server Role
- EtherIdentity server receives the KYC Hash and Private Key **only** at the minting stage
- It verifies the hash and initiates NFT creation
- Retains key only temporarily for legal traceability

### Legal Access
- In case of legal request, institutions can present the encrypted file to EtherIdentity
- EtherIdentity may reveal the corresponding private key **only with a court order**

## Use Cases
- Identity verification for crypto exchanges
- Secure onboarding for DeFi platforms
- Decentralized citizenship/ID programs
- Anonymous but verifiable identity in Web3
