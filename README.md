EtherIdentity
EtherIdentity is a decentralized KYC (Know Your Customer) solution built on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to provide a more secure, privacy-preserving method for identity verification, especially for users in the cryptocurrency space. By leveraging blockchain technology, it ensures that identity data cannot be tampered with, and only authorized entities can verify it.

This application uses modern cryptography, blockchain technology, and decentralized principles to allow users to verify their identity without relying on centralized authorities. It is designed for users, exchanges, and investors, each having distinct roles in the ecosystem.

Project Overview
EtherIdentity provides users with a secure and private method to manage their identity information. The user's identity is encrypted and stored on the Ethereum blockchain. The data is verified using a decentralized mechanism, and users can share it without exposing their personal details.

Decentralized Identity: Users have full control of their identity information. It’s encrypted and stored only on their device until they choose to share it with exchanges or any other parties.

Privacy-Preserving: User identity data is encrypted using AES encryption and hashed using SHA-256 before being stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring that only authorized entities can access the real data.

NFT Minting: The encrypted data is converted into an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) on the Ethereum blockchain, representing the user's verified identity. The NFT allows third-party services (such as exchanges) to validate the user's identity without exposing sensitive data.

Cross-Platform: Built with Flutter, EtherIdentity is compatible with both Android and iOS, providing a seamless experience across devices.

How EtherIdentity Works
For Users
Sign Up Process:

The user fills in their personal information: full name, ID number, address, email, phone number, etc.

They upload identity verification documents, such as front and back images of an ID card, a selfie, and undergo liveness detection (for identity validation).

Data Encryption:

The user’s personal information is encrypted using AES encryption.

The private key is generated and used to encrypt the data.

The data is also hashed using SHA-256 before being stored on the blockchain, ensuring integrity.

Minting an NFT:

The encrypted and hashed identity data is then minted into a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) on the Ethereum blockchain.

This NFT serves as the user’s digital identity that can be verified without exposing the raw data.

Authentication & Login:

Users can authenticate with biometric data (e.g., fingerprint, face recognition) or a PIN to access their identity within the application.

Secure Access:

Only authorized parties (such as exchanges or trusted entities) can verify the user’s identity using the kycHash, which is a hash of the identity information combined with the private key.

For Exchanges
Identity Verification:

Exchanges can use EtherIdentity to verify a user’s identity without seeing the actual personal data.

Exchanges check the kycHash against the blockchain to confirm the validity of the user's identity.

No Access to Personal Data:

Exchanges do not have access to sensitive personal data. They can only confirm whether the NFT metadata matches the user’s identity verification.

If the kycHash from the NFT matches, the exchange can proceed with identity verification.

Compliance:

Exchanges can use EtherIdentity to comply with KYC/AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations without storing sensitive personal information.

For Investors
Trust in Verified Identities:

Investors can rely on EtherIdentity to verify the legitimacy of identities on exchanges, ensuring that there is no identity fraud.

Investors can trust that the identities on the platform are validated and stored securely, making the crypto market more trustworthy.

Blockchain Transparency:

Investors can be confident that their identities and any other related data on the blockchain are immutable and protected from tampering.

Secure Transactions:

Since the identity verification is secured by cryptographic means, investors can engage in transactions with confidence, knowing the identity verification process is decentralized and secure.

Technological Features & Techniques
Blockchain Integration
EtherIdentity uses Ethereum as the underlying platform for storing identity data and verification hashes. Ethereum provides a decentralized network that ensures the integrity and transparency of identity data while keeping it secure.

Minting NFTs: The encrypted identity data is stored in the metadata of NFTs minted on the Ethereum blockchain. Each NFT represents a verified identity.

Smart Contracts: Smart contracts on Ethereum help automate identity verification and ensure transparency.

Cryptography
AES-256: All personal data is encrypted using AES encryption. AES is widely recognized for its strength and security.

SHA-256 Hashing: Personal information is hashed before being stored on the blockchain. The hash ensures that the data cannot be tampered with or altered after being written to the blockchain.

Private Key Ownership: The user’s private key is used to encrypt and decrypt their identity data, ensuring that only the authorized user can access their personal information.

Decentralization
EtherIdentity takes advantage of decentralized architecture:

No Centralized Server: Unlike traditional identity management systems, EtherIdentity does not rely on a central authority. All identity data is encrypted and controlled by the user.

Immutable Storage: Identity data, once stored on the blockchain, cannot be altered, making it resistant to fraud and tampering.

How It Works from a Technical Perspective
Encryption and Decryption Process
Encryption: When a user enters their personal data, the information is encrypted using AES-256 encryption. A private key is used to encrypt the data, which only the user can access.

Decryption: When the identity data needs to be verified, the data is decrypted using the private key. Only the user or authorized parties with access to the private key can decrypt the data.

Minting NFTs for Identity Verification
NFT Metadata: The encrypted identity data is stored as metadata in an NFT. The NFT is minted on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring that the data cannot be tampered with after it’s recorded.

kycHash: The kycHash is a hash of the user’s encrypted data combined with their private key, ensuring that the identity is uniquely tied to the user’s cryptographic information.
